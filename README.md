# ATM-Malware-Scraper
This is a simple script that scrapes atm malware samples.

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

## How does it work?

It works by parsing the hashes & names, using RegEx and splitting the string. Then it'll use a requests session with an authorization token used on the actual website, in order to authenticate users to send a GET request to the downloads url with the hash inserted. After that it's simple, all you need to do is save the response from the webpage in bytes to a file.
